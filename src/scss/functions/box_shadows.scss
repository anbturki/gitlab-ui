/*
 * Functions library
 *
 * Naming conventions
 *
 * Prefix the function names with the gl- namespace
 * Use static values as name of function
 * Use default values where possible
 * Ex: gl-shadow-inset-0-2-2-0($color: $black)
 *
 * Note:
 * It may make more sense to name the function something more
 * explicit, such as gl-focus-outer-glow where we want all focused
 * elements to have the same blue outer glow.
 *
 * Or gl-inset-border-2 which is more descriptive of what that is
 * trying to do. In this case it is mimicking an inset border, not
 * a shadow so it makes sense to explicitly call it a "border"
 * box-shadow settings for reference
 * inset | offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius | color
